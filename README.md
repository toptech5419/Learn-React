# 🚀 My React Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to the story of how I learned **React.js** on scrimba, one of the most powerful libraries for building modern user interfaces.

---

## 🌱 Getting Started

At the beginning, I was curious — I had heard so much about React and how it powers apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Netflix. I decided to take the leap and dive into this awesome technology.

- 🔰 Started with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- 📚 Watched tutorials on YouTube, read blogs, and followed React docs
- 🤯 Faced a bit of confusion with JSX and components... but I kept going!

---

## ⚛️ My First React App

I created my first app using **Vite** for fast dev setup:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then I built:

All the projects under this repository accordingly as i'm practicing.

## 🔄 Understanding React Concepts

Here’s what I mastered along the way:

- 📦 **Components** (functional and a bit of class)
- 💬 **Props** and **state**
- 🔁 **useState**, **useEffect**, and other hooks
- 🌍 **React Router** for navigation
- 🧠 Thinking in components and state management

---

## 💻 Projects I Built

To reinforce my learning, I built several mini-projects:

- ✅ A React To-Do List
- ✅ A Weather App using API
- ✅ A Conference Ticket Generator
- ✅ An AI-powered text processor
- ✅ Many smaller UI experiments and challenges

---

## 🧠 Challenges I Faced

- Understanding how props flow through nested components
- Dealing with "lifting state up" and prop-drilling
- Troubleshooting deployment issues on **Vercel/Netlify**
- Image importing issues with paths (fixed using `import`!)

---

## 🚀 What I Use Now

- ⚡ **Vite** for React projects
- 🧩 **React Router** for navigation
- 🧠 **useState**, **useEffect**, and custom hooks
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- 🔐 Backend with **Node.js** when needed
- ☁️ Deployed projects on **Vercel** & **Netlify**

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

I plan to:

- 🔥 Master advanced state management with **Redux** 
- 📱 Learn **React Native** for mobile apps
- 🌐 Dive deeper into **Next.js** and server-side rendering
- 💼 Build more real-world projects and contribute to open source
