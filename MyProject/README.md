ðŸš€ **Completed Scrimba's React Basics (Section 1)** â€” Fundamentals of building static pages with React!  

## ðŸ“š What I Learned:

- **Setting Up React** â€“ `create-react-app` / `Vite` and project structure.  
- **JSX** â€“ Writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.  
- **Custom Components** â€“ Breaking UI into reusable pieces.  
- **Styling** â€“ CSS modules, inline styles, and dynamic classes.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways:  
- Reactâ€™s component model makes UI code scalable and maintainable.  
- JSX blends markup and logic seamlessly.  
- Styling in React is flexible (CSS-in-JS, modules, or traditional CSS).
